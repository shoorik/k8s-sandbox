A Kubernetes Pod is a group of one or more Containers, tied together for the purposes of administration and networking. The Pod in this tutorial has only one Container. A Kubernetes Deployment checks on the health of your Pod and restarts the Podâ€™s Container if it terminates. Deployments are the recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.

Create a Deployment that manages a Pod

```
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
```

View deployments

```
kubectl get deployments
```

View pods

```
kubectl get pods
```

View events for the entire cluster

```
kubectl get events
```

View kubectl configuration (all clusters, etc)

Stored in ~/.kube/config file:

```
kubectl config view
```

Expose as service

By default, the Pod is only accessible by its internal IP address within the Kubernetes cluster. To make the hello-node Container accessible from outside the Kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the Pod as a Kubernetes Service.

```
kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```

Review services

```
kubectl get services
```

Run the service

http://localhost:8080

Clearing

```
kubectl delete service hello-node
```

then

```
kubectl delete deployment hello-node
```
